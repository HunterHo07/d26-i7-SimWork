# SimWork: The Future of Work Simulation

## About SimWork

SimWork is an AI-driven immersive work simulation platform that revolutionizes how people learn, practice, and demonstrate professional skills. By combining game mechanics with realistic work scenarios, SimWork creates an engaging environment where users can develop practical skills across multiple roles:

- **Developer**: Code in real terminals, solve programming challenges
- **Designer**: Create and submit designs for AI evaluation
- **Project Manager**: Coordinate tasks and manage resources
- **Data Entry**: Practice accuracy and efficiency in data processing
- **AI Engineer**: Craft prompts and optimize AI workflows

## Why SimWork Exists

Traditional training and hiring processes are broken:

- **Wrong Hires, Wasted Money**: Companies hire based on interviews, not demonstrated skills
- **Fake Skills, No Real Test**: Candidates can talk about skills but rarely prove them
- **Slow, Inefficient Hiring**: Multiple rounds of interviews without seeing actual work output
- **No KPI or Proof of Skill**: Limited data on actual performance capabilities

SimWork solves these problems by providing an immersive environment where skills can be demonstrated, measured, and improved in a realistic context.

## Key Features

- **Immersive 2.5D Environment**: Navigate a stylized workspace with different role stations
- **Real Tool Integration**: Use actual terminals, design interfaces, and data entry forms
- **AI-Powered Adaptivity**: Tasks adjust in difficulty based on user performance
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Track accuracy, speed, and decision quality
- **Procedural Challenges**: AI-generated tasks ensure variety and relevance

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Vision & Roadmap

SimWork is evolving through three key phases:

1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: Web-based 2.5D simulation with core roles and tasks
2. **Phase 2**: Desktop/mobile apps with expanded scenarios and role options
3. **Phase 3**: VR/AR integration and multiplayer enterprise modules
